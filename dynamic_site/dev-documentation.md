## Build the frontend source

The frontend is written in Typescript for improved clarity, so to build the source, move into the `frontend-source` directory and run the Typescript compiler `tsc`.
NodeJS is needed, so first run `npm install` or `yarn`.
For development the watchdog Typescript compiler can be run with `yarn build`.

```sh
cd web/frontend-source
yarn
yarn build
```
