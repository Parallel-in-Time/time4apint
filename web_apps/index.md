## Motivations

Develop a python code based on a generic framework allowing to investigate and analyze the performance of iterative parallel-in-time (PinT) algorithms : [blockops](./blockops/)

Implement a graphical user interface that could be exposed through a [**demonstration website (web api)**](./accuracy).

> Take a look at the [API Demonstration](./demo)

## Base convention

Represent an iterative PinT algorithm with a **block iteration** of the form

$$
u_{n+1}^{k+1} = B_1^0 u_{n+1}^k + B_0^0 u_{n}^k + B_0^1 u_{n}^{k+1} + ...
$$

with $B_i^j$ the **block coefficient**, built using one or a combination of **block operators** (addition, substraction, multiplication, inverse).
For instance, looking at the Parareal algorithm, we have

$$
u_{n+1}^{k+1} = (F - G) u_{n}^k + G u_{n}^{k+1},
$$

with $F$ and $G$ the block operators.
Then we have two block coefficients $B_0^0 = F-G$ and $B_0^1 = G$. Note that the same block operator can be present in several block coefficients.

**Note** : block coefficients indices don't depend on $k$ and $n$, but on the offset.
Hence, $B_1^0$ is the block coefficient for the $u_{n+1}^{k+0}$ term, and the block coefficient for the $u_{n-1}^{k+1}$ term would then be $B_{-1}^{1}$.

Any combination of block operators can be seen as a unique block operator, hence a block coefficient is itself a combination of block operators and also a block operator. This aspect is fully used in the framework implementation.
